Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
2.   Asks the user to input a student's name.
3.   Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
4.   If the studentâ€™s name is not found, display an appropriate message.

Solution : 
student_marks ={
    "Faizan":87,
    "Shobhit":90,
    "manu": 89,
    "om":78
}
student_name = input("Enter the student name :")
if student_name in student_marks:
    print(f"{student_name}: {student_marks[student_name]}")
else:
    print("student not found in the record.")



Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
2.   Extracts the first five elements from the list.
3.   Reverses these extracted elements.
4.   Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list

Solution:
number = list(range(1,11))
extracted_list = number[:5]
reversed_list = extracted_list[::-1]
print("extracted_list",extracted_list)
print("reversed_list",reversed_list)
