Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.


  Solution: 
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2
if num2 != 0:
    division = num1 / num2
else:
    division = "Undefined (division by zero)"
print("\nResults:")
print(f"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition}")
print(f"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction}")
print(f"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication}")
print(f"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division}")


Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.  Takes a user's first name and last name as input.
2.  Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.
3.  Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.


solution:
first_name = input("Enter your first name: ")
last_name = input("Enter your last name: ")
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(f"Hello, {full_name}! Welcome!")
