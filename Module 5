Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors 
Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1.   Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
2.   Prints its content line by line.
3.   Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

 solution:
try:
    with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
        for line in file:
            print(line.strip()) 
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: The file 'sample.txt' does not exist.")
except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
2.   Appends additional data to the same file.
3.   Reads and displays the final content of the file.

 solution:
try:
    with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
        user_input = input("Enter text to write to the file: ")
        file.write(user_input + "\n")

    with open("output.txt", "a") as file:
        additional_input = input("Enter additional text to append: ")
        file.write(additional_input + "\n")
    with open("output.txt", "r") as file:
        print("\nFinal content of 'output.txt':")
        for line in file:
            print(line.strip())
except Exception as e:
    print("An error occurred: {e}")
